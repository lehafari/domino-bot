# Domino Bot Library

This project is a TypeScript library designed to simulate a domino-playing bot. The bot supports different strategies for playing dominos, with the current implementation including a **basic strategy**. The bot makes moves based on the player's hand and the current state of the board.

## Features

- **Basic Strategy**: A simple algorithm that chooses the best tile to play based on current board state.

- **Support for Various Strategies**: The library is designed to support multiple strategies, with placeholders for intermediate and advanced strategies.
